        <p> Rocio Yasmin Calles borned and raised most of her life in El salvador, a Central America country she developed a passion about the animals' well fare from a very young age although El Salvador is one of the countries where animals are brutally abused and where many of precious species of animals have been exctinted or are currently in danger of this to happen. Furthermore, she grew up in the capital of her country where her mother would always raise animals not all as pets, but as a resource of food. Even then in her childhood, she would refused to eat what was made from all the precius animals she saw growing up.
        Vegetarian most of her life and currently and proud of being a vegan, she founded this non profit organization advocating for animals rights and trying to make this movement part of our society. In 2013, at the age of 23, she attended The Great World Congress Meeting for the Protection of Animals. From 2015 she ran a 237-acre animal sanctuary in Upstate New york where animals from close and far away countries would find a forever new home.  </p></div>

            <p> Our organization started with a simple thought from our founder. As she saw her "one and only" dog Fido go downfall when he developed cancer that ultimately ended up with his precious life. Unable to do anything back then hence help in those poor countries is scarce for animals and her family didn't have enough resources to get Fido the treatment he needed, her family had no choice but to let him die. She blamed herself for so many years, however; now rescuing other precious lives in a way feels as a small amount of compensation for what she couldn't do back then for her precious and unforgettable Fido.
                 Always beloved and remembered FIDO - R.I.P 2004 </p></div>
